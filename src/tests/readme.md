# tests
Documenting reading and thoughts around testing methods. I'm familiar with end-to-end, integration and unit tests.

## End-to-End
End-to-end (e2e) tests the functionality from start to finish, simulating what a real user's journey might be on your site. 

### Tools
- Puppeter
Carries out the test from a user perspective; also for web scraping

- Cypress
Also another e2e framework

- Selenium

## Integration

## Unit
- Jest
Created for testing React, can be used to test Babel, JS, Node, Angular, Vue, Nest and GraphQL.
