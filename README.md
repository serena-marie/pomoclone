# pomoclone
A standard pomodoro timer, inspired by pomofocus.io. Working on adding in some additional features I'd like to see such as a calendar breakdown of the pomos and easily adding / subtracting time from an active timer.

## To Be Implemented
- [ ] Reporting display as Calendar view which highlights breaks & pomo windows
  - [x] Record data / time 
  - [ ] Implement calendar view
- [ ] Timer redesigns ; had some thoughts need to draft up
- [ ] Audio
- [x] Add / Subtract focus time - should be able to be changed while the timer is going
- [x] Start a shorter pomo window more easily
- [x] Session Management

## To use locally
1. In project directory, run `npm install` 
2. Then, run `npm start`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in browser
